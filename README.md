# Rendering Input Values on Button Click in React

This mini project demonstrates how I learned to render input values in React when a button is clicked. I followed a step-by-step approach from [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qd4_KIXdcI).

## What I Learned

- How to use `useState` to manage input field values.
- Handling user input in real-time.
- Updating displayed values only when a button is clicked.
- Best practices for separating input state and rendered output.

This helped me better understand React hooks and how to control state-driven rendering in a simple user interface.
